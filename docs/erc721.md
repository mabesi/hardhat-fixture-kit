# NFT Seeding Guide

Testing NFT integration often requires holding a specific NFT, sometimes with specific properties (metadata) that only exist on certain Token IDs.

The `stealNFT` function allows you to seize control of **any** ERC-721 token on the fork.

## Usage

```typescript
import { stealNFT } from "hardhat-fixture-kit";

await stealNFT({
  nftAddress: "0xBC4CA0EdA7647A8aB7C2061c2E118A18a936f13D", // BAYC Contract
  tokenId: 1234, // The ID you want
  to: "0xYourTestUserAddress..."
});
```

## How it works

1. **Owner Lookup**: Queries `nft.ownerOf(tokenId)` to find the current holder.
2. **Impersonation**: Impersonates that holder using `hardhat_impersonateAccount`.
3. **Gas Check**: Ensures the holder has enough ETH for gas. If not, funds them.
4. **Transfer**: Executes `transferFrom(holder, to, tokenId)`.
5. **Cleanup**: Stops impersonating the holder.

## Considerations

- The transaction will fail if the NFT is "Soulbound" or has transfer restrictions.
- You must hold the NFT in the state of the block number you forked from. If the NFT was burned or didn't exist at that block, this will fail.
